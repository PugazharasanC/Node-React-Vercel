# Node-React-Vercel

1.Prepare Your React App: Make sure your React app is ready for deployment. This typically involves having a package.json file with dependencies and build scripts defined.

2.Create a vercel.json Configuration File: This file allows you to specify deployment settings for your project. You can define routes, redirects, headers, etc. Here's a simple example:

{
"rewrites": [
{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
]
}

3.Push your code to your git repository (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
4.Import your React project into Vercel.
5.Vercel will detect that you are using React and will enable the correct settings for your deployment.
Your application is deployed! (e.g. create-react-template.vercel.app)
